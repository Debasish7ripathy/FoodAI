# AI Food Pantry

## Overview

AI Food Pantry is an advanced application designed to streamline meal planning and food management using artificial intelligence. The platform features food analysis and menu generation capabilities, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and various machine learning tools to provide personalized meal suggestions and nutritional insights. 

## Features

- **Food Analysis**: Automatically analyze nutritional content and categorize food items based on dietary preferences and restrictions.
  
- **Menu Generation**: Generate personalized meal plans based on user preferences, available ingredients, and nutritional goals.

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Utilize various ML algorithms for food classification, sentiment analysis of recipes, and user behavior prediction.

- **MLOps Pipeline**: Implement a robust MLOps framework for continuous integration and deployment of ML models.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: 
  - Python (Flask or FastAPI)
  - PostgreSQL for database management
  - Redis for caching

- **Machine Learning Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning
  - Hugging Face Transformers for RAG
  - GEMINI(GOOGLE)

- **Data Processing**: 
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - NumPy for numerical operations
  - OpenCV for image processing (if applicable)

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js or Vue.js for building a user-friendly interface
  - Axios for API calls

- **MLOps Tools**: 
  - MLflow for tracking experiments
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for orchestration
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
  

2. **Set up the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up the database**:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database and update the connection string in `config.py`.

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Food Analysis**: 
   - Upload food items or enter them manually to analyze nutritional content.
   - Access detailed insights including calories, macronutrients, and allergens.

2. **Menu Generation**: 
   - Select dietary preferences and available ingredients.
   - Generate a weekly menu with recipes tailored to user specifications.
